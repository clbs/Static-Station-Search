# Map-Search

Static Station or Asset Map Locator for maps created in Excel.

This program allows you to make a map file in excel, export the map as an HTML webpage and create dynamic reports based on asset data.

This was primarily used in a restrictive environment to track asset due dates and locations in a restrictive environment where
no external software could be used.
